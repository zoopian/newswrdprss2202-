== HOW IT WORKS ==

**Select a condition >> Set a version of content to be displayed if it is met.**


= All page builder users =

1. Create a trigger.
2. Select a condition and set the personalized content version.
3. Optional - create more dynamic versions and set the default content.
4. Paste the shortcode wherever you want to display the content.
Whenever a page with the shortcode is loaded, one of the content versions will be displayed accordingly.

= Gutenberg and Elementor users =

1. Select the block or element.
2. On the side menu, select the condition to display the block/element.

== HTML5 Geolocation API (browser location) ==

The Geolocation API-based content option is an alternative method for presenting location-specific content. This approach is significantly more accurate in determining the user’s location compared to the IP-to-location method (which is not crucial at the country and state level, but might be significant at the city level).

The drawback of this approach is that it necessitates the user’s consent to share their location.

The HTML5 Geolocation API method can be used in addition to or instead of the IP-to-location service.

== LOCATION OVERRIDE (MANUAL USER LOCATION SELECTION) ==

With the manual user location selection option, users can override the location detected by our IP-to-location service and manually select a different location. This allows for dynamic content to be displayed based on the user's chosen location.

== LOG GEOLOCATION REQUESTS ==

Track bots that visit your site and exhaust your session quota. Log the geolocation requests to identify their IPs, analyze them,  and chose if you want to block them from the geolocation service. 
Although the site will remain open to visits from the blocked IPs, the geolocation service will be disabled for them and default content will be displayed instead of the location-based version.
